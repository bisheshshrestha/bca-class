						<b>MISSION</b><br><br>
						FoodLover means great regional meals along highways, in small towns and in city neighborhoods. It is sleeves-up fare made by cooks, bakers, pitmasters, and sandwich-makers who are Americaâ€™s culinary folk artists.<br><br>
						FoodLover restaurants are almost always casual and affordable. They are diners, small-town cafes, seaside shacks, drive-ins, barbecues, and bake shops. The best of them are colorful places enjoyed by locals (and savvy travelers) for their character as well as their menu.<br><br>
						It is our intention that FoodLover lead the way to:
						<ul>
						<li>great local color</li>
						<li>the best regional specialties</li>
						<li>unforgettable meals that are the highlights of the trip</li>
						</ul>
